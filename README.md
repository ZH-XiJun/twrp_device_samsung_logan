Generated by [twrpdtgen](https://github.com/twrpdtgen/twrpdtgen).

## Download

Jump to [here](https://github.com/ZH-XiJun/Action-TWRP-Builder/releases) and find out the device `logan`.

Some devices have two or more releases. Pls make sure you have downloaded the latest release. 

If the device cannot be found, that means I haven't built it yet or I failed to build it. Please build it by yourself.

## Build

I used [Action TWRP builder](https://github.com/azwhikaru/Action-TWRP-Builder) for building TWRP. Fork it and read its README.md
